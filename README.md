# Encryption With Substitution Cipher

This is just a program for me to practise Substitution Cipher Encryption. It's not really secure for modern standard, especially for longer text will be easier to decrypt but it's just for gaining basic understanding about this encryption method.
## How to Use
Make sure you are on the right file

```bash
javac panel.java
java panel
```

## Usage
There should be a JFrame panel pop up. Choose the txt file that you want to encrypt by clicking Encrypt Button. The File you chose should now be in .enc  format, as well as a new txt file created(Key.txt) with your decryption Key inside. To decrypt an encrypted file, enter the Key first in the text bar and choose the file to be decrypt by clicking the Decryption Button. The file you chose should now back to txt format
